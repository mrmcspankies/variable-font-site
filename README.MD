This project is a showcase of all aspect of the variable font, Science Gothic. The history, different font settings, the character set, etc. Since this font is a blocky text I thought it would be cool to theme the website as a old computer/word processor. Black background and light green text with simple graphics. Through this project I learned a lot of CSS and little bit of html. Before this project I was confident in html and not CSS but now I am. I learned how to animate a variable font and CSS grid. To be clear I did not use CSS grid in my final website but I did play around with it.
