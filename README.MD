This project is a showcase of all aspect of the variable font, Science Gothic. The history, different font settings, the character set, etc. Since this font is a blocky text I thought it would be cool to theme the website as a old computer/word processor. Black background and light green text with simple graphics. Through this project I learned a lot of CSS and little bit of html. Before this project I was confident in html and not CSS but now I am. I learned how to animate a variable font and CSS grid. To be clear I did not use CSS grid in my final website but I did play around with it. I dont use CSS grid because I was able to achieve what I wanted with the margin command, spacing out the different sections of the page. Learning how to link different elements of html to css was key into making this website work. Being able to split up different elements helped organize the page. What makes this website stick out is that the nav bar is not stuck to the top of the screen but the bottom. Convention is to have the nav bar up top. I used Figjam to create mockups for the website and I did not deviate far from the orginal mockup. My intention was to keep it simple with the main focus being the hero section where each letter has its own animation.
